# Gesture-Controlled Music Player with Emotion Recognition

This project combines **gesture recognition** and **emotion detection** to create an interactive music player. The system uses a webcam to capture the user's hand gestures and facial expressions. Based on the detected gestures and emotions, the system plays different music tracks to match the user's mood and actions.

## Features
- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Control music playback (play, pause, skip) with hand gestures.
- **Emotion Detection**: The system detects facial expressions (happy, sad, angry, etc.) and plays appropriate music based on the detected emotion.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly interface to view real-time webcam feed and interact with the system.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and handling webcam input.
- **MediaPipe**: For hand gesture recognition.
- **DeepFace**: For emotion detection based on facial expressions.
- **Streamlit**: To build the interactive web interface.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: For image format conversion.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Webcam**: To capture the user's gestures and facial expressions.
- **Computer**: 
  - Processor: Multi-core CPU (Intel Core i5 or better).
  - RAM: Minimum 8 GB.
  - Storage: Sufficient space for storing music files and application data.
- **Speakers/Headphones**: For audio playback.

## Software Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
- **Required Python Libraries**:
  - `opencv-python`: For webcam capture and image processing.
  - `mediapipe`: For hand gesture recognition.
  - `deepface`: For emotion analysis.
  - `streamlit`: For building the web interface.
  - `pillow`: For image processing.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
